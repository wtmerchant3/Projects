      <h1>Classes</h1>
      <p><strong>Product Inventory Project</strong> - Create an application which manages an inventory of products. Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an <em>inventory</em> class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.</p>
      <p><strong>Airline / Hotel Reservation System</strong> - Create a reservation system which books airline seats or hotel rooms. It charges various rates for particular sections of the plane or hotel. Example, first class is going to cost more than coach. Hotel rooms have penthouse suites which cost more. Keep track of when rooms will be available and can be scheduled.</p>
      <p><strong>Company Manager</strong> - Create an hierarchy of classes - abstract class Employee and subclasses HourlyEmployee, SalariedEmployee, Manager and Executive. Every one's pay is calculated differently, research a bit about it. After you've established an employee hierarchy, create a Company class that allows you to manage the employees. You should be able to hire, fire and raise employees.</p>
      <p><strong>Bank Account Manager</strong> - Create a class called Account which will be an abstract class for three other classes called CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount and BusinessAccount. Manage credits and debits from these accounts through an ATM style program.</p>
      <p><strong>Patient / Doctor Scheduler</strong> - Create a patient class and a doctor class. Have a doctor that can handle multiple patients and setup a scheduling program where a doctor can only handle 16 patients during an 8 hr work day.</p>
      <p><strong>Recipe Creator and Manager</strong> - Create a recipe class with ingredients and a put them in a recipe manager program that organizes them into categories like deserts, main courses or by ingredients like chicken, beef, soups, pies etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Image Gallery</strong> - Create an image abstract class and then a class that inherits from it for each image type. Put them in a program which displays them in a gallery style format for viewing.</p>
      <p><strong>Shape Area and Perimeter Classes</strong> - Create an abstract class called Shape and then inherit from it other shapes like diamond, rectangle, circle, triangle etc. Then have each class override the area and perimeter functionality to handle each shape type.</p>
      <p><strong>Flower Shop Ordering To Go</strong> - Create a flower shop application which deals in flower objects and use those flower objects in a bouquet object which can then be sold. Keep track of the number of objects and when you may need to order more.</p>
      <p><strong>Family Tree Creator</strong> - Create a class called Person which will have a name, when they were born and when (and if) they died. Allow the user to create these Person classes and put them into a family tree structure. Print out the tree to the screen.</p>
